# Project Objective
To develop a Machine Learning (ML) web application using GitLab and Flask Framework, incorporating the 3 DevOps best practices mentioned in the Background section. This is an open-ended assessment. 

For this project, we will be using the Covid, Flu, Allergy and Cold symptoms and making a machine learning model to do classification to help predict what is the user is currently experiencing. 

# Background Information
In Singapore, due to our humid environment, many people get cold and flu. In 2021, 588 deaths caused by flu and the cold in Singapore alone. Furthermore, 24% of Singaporeans are allergic to pollen. As the symptoms of all 3 illness are very similar, knowing which one you have is very crucial especially if it is very serious.

During the Covid 19 pandemic many Singaporeans despite having a small symptoms like cough and sneezing, they will go to their nearby hospitals and general clinics to check if they have been infected by Covid-19. This not only increase the likelihood of other Singaporeans getting affected as they travel along the common corridors in Singapore, but also increase the workload of the hospitals and general clinics. This prompted the Singaporean Government to launch campaigns to promote and educate citizens on what they can do when they experience symptoms similar to Covid-19.
